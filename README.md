# Physical Activity Monitoring Analysis using Machine Learning Models
The dataset utilised for this project is a Physical Activity Monitoring Dataset, which is an Activity
Monitoring dataset that comprises 12 core and 6 extra physical activities performed by 9
individuals, 8 men and 1 woman, utilising three inertial measurement units and a heart rate
monitor. I would be cleaning this data, carrying out an EDA, state a predictive hypothesis which I
would be developing a model to test and give an actionable recommendation based on my
analysis.

The goal of this project is to gather insights based on the findings of my investigation to
establish how active an individual is based on physical activities that will be utilised for
developing hardware and software.
