# Physical Activity Monitoring Analysis using Machine Learning Models
The dataset used for this project is the Physical Activity Monitoring Dataset, which includes data from 9 individuals (8 men and 1 woman) performing 12 core and 6 additional physical activities. The data was collected using three inertial measurement units and a heart rate monitor. My objective is to clean this data, conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA), formulate a predictive hypothesis, develop a model to test this hypothesis, and provide actionable recommendations based on my analysis.

The primary goal of this project is to derive insights from the data to assess an individual's activity level based on their physical activities. These insights will inform the development of both hardware and software solutions aimed at accurately monitoring and enhancing physical activity levels.
